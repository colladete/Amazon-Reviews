# Predicting positive and negative Amazon reviews with a Neural Network

In this Kernel, I am going to use the Amazon Fine Food ReviewsÂ to predict, based on the user comment, whether the review was positive or negative.

This kernel includes:

  - Text preprocessing, including the use of the NLTK library.
  - Neural Network with TensorFlow.
