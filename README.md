# Predicting positive and negative Amazon reviews with a Neural Network

In this Kernel, I am going to use the Amazon Fine Food ReviewsÂ to predict, based on the user comment, whether the review was positive or negative.

This kernel includes:

  - Text preprocessing, including the use of the NLTK library.
  - Neural Network with TensorFlow.

[Here is the Kernel](https://github.com/colladete/Amazon-Reviews/blob/master/Predicting%2Bpositive%2Band%2Bnegative%2BAmazon%2Breviews%2Bwith%2Ba%2BNeural%2BNetwork.ipynb)
